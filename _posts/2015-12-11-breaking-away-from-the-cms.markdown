Whenever I see a small company like a restaurant or small company's website using a CMS such as Wordpress, I often wonder what brought them to the conclusion that that was the way to go. CMS's in general are bloated, slow and are relatively expensive, so why use one at all?

CMS-less websites have gathered steam in 2015 with the [argument]{:target="_blank"} that they're faster, easier to maintain and a lot cheaper. Let's take a quick look at the pro's and con's of swicthing to a static website over something like Wordprss. 

### The Pro's

1. **Speed**. It requires no database. This is the most common bottleneck when it comes to web applications.
2. **Hosting**. This site is statically hosted in an AWS S3 bucket, which costs me around USD$0.10 a month. A common service like GoDaddy hosting starts at around USD$10, which is 100 times more expensive.
3. **Security**. Since the site is hosted by AWS, you won't need to login or remember any passwords. 
4.
