Across the year of 2014, I had to make some of Mediaworks' biggest radio websites work on mobile. With not enough time to properly incorporate Bootstrap or another responsive framework, I simply had to remove everything that wasn't needed, and make the websites fit into the palm of your hand. I did 5 websites throughout the year, starting with [The Edge]{:target="_blank"}, then on to [The Rock]{:target="_blank"}, [MaiFM]{:target="_blank"}, [GeorgeFM]{:target="_blank"}, and finally [RadioLIVE]{:target="_blank"}.
