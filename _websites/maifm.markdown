The MaiFM radio website went through a massive redesign in 2016, moving to a new CMS and an entirely new development process. The site was built using Broccoli, then it's components were imported into Adobe Experience Manager. This project used a wide range of tools, including Broccoli, Sass, Handlebars and more.
