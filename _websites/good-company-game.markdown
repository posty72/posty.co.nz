I was asked to build a game that our salespeople could take out to clients and demonstrate some of our compnay values. I was given two weeks to build it and it had to work on iPad (and only iPad).

Having never built a game before, I spend the first few days finding the best approach to take. I settled on using HTML5 canvas because of it's speed when combined with `requestAnimationFrame`. While it's not perfect (there are WAY too many hard-coded values), we were really happy with how it turned out.
