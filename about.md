#### Who am I?&nbsp;

I am a front end developer from Balclutha, NZ. I grew up playing rugby, spending time on the farm and spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### What have I done?&nbsp;

As of the start of 2017 I work for Pixel Fusion in Auckland. We make high-quality digital products and take pride in our work. Technologies we use include React with Redux and Laravel, but we don't limit ourselves to specific frameworks.

&nbsp;

Previously, I worked at MediaWorks as a front end developer. I worked with content management systems to integrate new advertising technology, updating designs, and creating brand new web properties.

&nbsp;

I've also worked with start-up companies including Publons, KidsGoMobile and others who were involved in the first Lightning Labs in Wellington. I co-founded a company called Last Minute Table in 2014 and worked as the technical lead, overseeing the development, applying design and managing servers and deployments.&nbsp;
