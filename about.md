### What can I do?&nbsp;

I create photographs and digital products.&nbsp;

I've been working professionally as a developer since 2013. I started making basic websites that were little more than marketing pages, and have since moved on to fully dynamic web applications. I focus on finding the best solution for problems, with extra care taken for performance, security and accessibility.&nbsp;

As an amateur photographer I take mostly landscape and lifestyle photos. I like when I can see the light sitting perfectly over a scene, and working out the best way of composing that into something worthwhile. I shoot with a Canon for digital and a Pentax for film.&nbsp;

### Where am I from?&nbsp;

I am from Balclutha, NZ. I grew up playing rugby, spending time on the farm and making memories with friends and family. I’ve since lived in Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland.

&nbsp;

### What have I done?&nbsp;

As of the start of 2017 I work for [Pixel Fusion](https://pixelfusion.co.nz) in Auckland. We make high-quality digital products and take pride in our work. Technologies we use include React with Redux and Laravel, but we don’t limit ourselves to specific frameworks.

Previously, I worked at MediaWorks as a front end developer. I worked with content management systems to integrate new advertising technology, updating designs, and creating brand new web properties.

I’ve also worked with start-up companies including Publons, KidsGoMobile and others who were involved in the first Lightning Labs in Wellington. I co-founded a company called Last Minute Table in 2014 and worked as the technical lead, overseeing the development, applying design and managing servers and deployments.&nbsp;
