#### Who am I?&nbsp;

I am a front end developer from Balclutha, NZ. I grew up playing rugby, spending time on the farm and spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As of the start of 2017 I work for Pixel Fusion in Auckland. We make high-quality digital products and take pride in our work. Technologies we use include React with Redux and Laravel, but we don't limit ourselves to specific frameworks.
